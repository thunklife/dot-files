#My Dot Files

These are my  .dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.
Except that I totally forked @mutewinter's (dot_vim)['https://github.com/mutewinter/dot_vim']
repo and took some mappings from @gf3's (dotfiles)['https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles'],
but other than that, they're totally  mine.

I'm super lazy and don't expect that anybody would use these so I'm not going
to list the Vim plugins I'm using here.

KTHXBAI
